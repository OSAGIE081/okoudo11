        <p>I am deeply passionate about engineering, technology, and innovation...</p>
        <p>I enjoy creating, designing, and finding practical solutions to real-world problems, especially in the areas of electrical and electronics engineering. I love working on projects that combine both theory and hands-on application, such as battery design, BMS development, and energy systems. I am also drawn to continuous learning, whether through coding, software development, or exploring new technical fields like solar installation and renewable energy. Beyond academics, I value leadership and teamwork, as shown in how Iâ€™ve led and contributed to projects. I also have a strong interest in personal growth, finance, and preparing for the future, including building a solid foundation for my career, family, and marriage.</p>
